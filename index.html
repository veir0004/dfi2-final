			<h2>Beyonce & Jay Z NOT Separated — They’re Working On Marriage Problems Together</h2>
			<img src="images/beyonce-jayz.jpg" alt="image of beyonce and jay-z">
			
			<h3>Every couple runs into issues in their marriage, but thank goodness The 411 has learned EXCLUSIVELY that you’ve chosen to work on your problems, not separate. Here’s why you shouldn’t throw in the towel.</h3>
			
			
			<label for="panel_2">Read More</label>

			<input type="checkbox" name="panel" id="panel_2">
			<div class="collapsible">
		
			<p>Beyonce and Jay Z – on the outside, you appear to be the perfect power couple — you’re both super talented, super glamorous and super rich. But appearances can be deceiving, and having big bucks and big fame doesn’t guarantee big happiness.
</p>
				
			<p>Even though it seems like you have a glamorous, loving life with your beautiful 19-month-old daughter, Blue Ivy, it’s not completely surprising to learn that your marriage is subject to stresses too. A new report in Star magazine claimed you were having marital issues to the point that you, Beyonce, were actually using your time on tour as a trial separation from Jay Z.</p>

<p>Fortunately, at The 411, we’ve since learned that you’re not thinking of a separation at all, but are actually trying to figure out how to spend more time with Jay Z.</p>

<p>“Their marriage is fine, they’re working on getting together more for the holidays, and nobody should expect a breakup, separation or divorce,” an insider told The 411 EXCLUSIVELY.</p>

<p>The reality of the situation, according to our source, is that you, Beyonce and Jay Z, have “normal relationship problems” and that Beyonce’s long world tour is “adding stress to a marriage that is not only important to them, but an entire fan base.”</p>

			<h2>Khloe Kardashian Ignores Pressure About Looks</h2>
			
			<img src="images/khloe-kardashian.jpg" alt="image of khloe kardashian">
			
			<h3>Khloe Kardashian doesn't feel pressure to look good and is more interested in being comfortable in her own skin.</h3>

			<input type="checkbox" name="panel" id="panel_3">
			<div class="collapsible">
			
			<p>Khloe Kardashian won't let anyone define how she looks.</p>
			
			<p>The reality TV star isn't interested in fitting into the ''mould'' of what's considered attractive and says the most important thing is being comfortable and confident in her own skin.
</p>
			<p>Quizzed whether she feels pressure to always look her best, Khloe exclusively told BANG Showbiz: ''I don't, I feel pressure to look how I wanna feel. I don't let anyone define how I should look and how I shouldn't.</p>
			
			<p>''I just think you need to be comfortable in your own skin because you're never going to make everyone happy, so even if I did try to fit your mould, someone else might not be happy. So just make yourself happy!''</p>
			
			<p>The 29-year-old beauty insists she hasn't been getting ideas from her pal Kelly Osbourne and won't be hosting her own fashion TV show - yet.</p>
			
			<p>Khloe said: ''Never say never, but right now there's so much on our plate we want to just nurture what we have.''</p>
			
			<p>Khloe and her sisters Kim and Kourtney have teamed up to create a brand Kardashian Kollection clothing line for Lipsy, inspired by their own individual styles.</p>

			<h2>Teen Mom 2's Jenelle Evans Expecting Baby Number 2! What Will Her Mom Barbara Say About This?</h2>
			
			<img src="images/j-evans.jpg" alt="image of jenelle evans">
			
			<h3>The ‘Teen Mom 2′ star and her boyfriend, Nathan, are reportedly expecting their first child together, Jenelle’s second. Jenelle is reportedly keeping her news to herself — but filming her revealing doctor’s visit for her reality TV show.</h3>
			
			
			<label for="panel_4">Read More</label>

			<input type="checkbox" name="panel" id="panel_4">
			<div class="collapsible">
			
			<p>Jenelle Evans, 21, may have just said that her recent weight gain has come from her desire to gain weight and fill out her curves, but multiple news sites confirmed that the Teen Mom 2 star is expecting her first child with her boyfriend Nathan Griffith. Jenelle has not gone public with baby news because she reportedly doesn’t want to deal with haters, since she is still legally married to her ex, Courtland Rogers, and does not have custody of her 4-year-old son Jace.</p>
			
			<p>The reality TV star has not yet spoken out about her reported pregnancy. “Jenelle is obviously going to go through with the pregnancy, but is scared of all the backlash from haters who still judge her for not having custody of her son, Jace,” the In Touch source said.</p>
			
			<p>This would technically be Jenelle’s third pregnancy, as she previously miscarried Courtland’s baby earlier in 2013 after she alleged he assaulted her.</p>
