			<h2>Drake's 'Nothing Was the Same' Debuts at No. 1 on Billboard 200 </h2>

			<h3>It's Official: As expected, Drake's "Nothing Was the Same" has debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard 200 albums chart with the second-largest sales week of 2013.</h3>
			
			<label for="panel_2">Read More</label>

			<div class="collapsible">
			
			<p>The album, the hip-hop star's third full-length release, sold 658,000 copies in its first week (ending Sunday, Sept. 29) according to Nielsen SoundScan. The only album to sell more copies in a week this year was Justin Timberlake's "The 20/20 Experience," when it bowed at No. 1 with 968,000 following its release in March.</p>
			<p>The rest of the new Billboard 200 chart's top 10 will be revealed on Wednesday, Oct. 2.</p>
			
			<p>"Nothing Was the Same" also gives Drake his personal best week ever. His last album, 2011's "Take Care," started at No. 1 with 631,000. His full-length debut, "Thank Me Later," launched with 447,000 at No. 1 in 2010. The year before that, his debut EP, "So Far Gone," bowed and peaked at No. 6 with 73,000.</p>
			
			<p>His debut is impressive, considering the set leaked to the internet a little more than a week before it hit retail. The album reached the Web on Sept. 15 -- well before its Sept. 24 street date. Of course, leaks are commonplace, especially with hip-hop releases. </p>
			
			<p>Drake's arrival with "Nothing Was the Same" is also the biggest week for any rap album since September of 2011, when Lil Wayne's "Tha Carter IV" debuted at No. 1 with 964,000. </p>
			
			<p>Since 2010, only seven other albums logged larger weeks than "Nothing Was the Same's" debut. Timberlake's "20/20" was one of them, obviously. Before that, in 2012, Taylor Swift's "Red" bowed with 1.2 million, while Adele's "21" surged to 730,000 in the week after her sweep at the Grammy Awards. In 2011, the previously mentioned Lil Wayne debuted, as did Lady Gaga with "Born This Way" (1.1 million). And, in 2010, Swift's "Speak Now" and Eminem's "Recovery" both started big: with 1 million and 741,000, respectively, in their first weeks.</p>

			<p>Drake's new album has already earned a pair of top 10 hits on the Hot R n B/Hip-Hop Songs chart: lead cut "Started From the Bottom" (peaking at No. 2) and "Hold On, We're Going Home" (No. 3). Last week, the set's "Wu-Tang Forever" reached No. 13 on the tally.</p>

			<h2>Katy Perry's 'PRISM': Track-By-Track Review</h2>

			<h3>Katy Perry released her sophomore album, "Teenage Dream," at the age of 25, but the 2010 effort pristinely captured the chirpy buoyancy of youth through gooey synth-pop.</h3>

			<div class="collapsible">
			
			<p>Perry is still championing optimism with super-producers Max Martin, Lukasz "Dr. Luke" Gottwald and Cirkut as her sonic guides -- see her latest chart-topper, "Roar" -- but "PRISM" is also a firm and well-executed step toward adulthood. New single "Unconditionally" trades in the idealistic love of "Teenage Dream" for a romance more realistic and reliable; elsewhere, Perry evokes her recent divorce ("Ghost") and its personal effects ("By The Grace of God") with slowed-down guitar hooks and thoughtful piano strikes. While the first half of "PRISM" flashes an array of sonic and lyrical colors, hopping from disco ("Walking on Air") to rap ("Dark Horse") to sumptuous pop-rock ("International Smile"), the second half feels more lived-in, with Perry patiently discussing her battles with hopeless relationships, struggles to understand herself and attempts to live for the moment in a whirlwind reality. These songs are not the bubblegum summer smashes of a California Gurl, but something much deeper from an artist striving to tell her full story.  "PRISM" has its share of candy-colored fun, but also something else: more detail in its tempered shades. With a string of hit singles under her belt, Perry has aspired to create a multi-faceted full-length and has consummately succeeded.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Which songs on "PRISM" are the best of the best? Check out our track-by-track take on Katy Perry's third album.</strong></p>
			
			<p><strong>1. Roar </strong>- On an album that contains multiple "I survived a trauma and am stronger for it" anthems, "Roar" is the most accessible, and deservedly became Perry's eighth No. 1 Hot 100 single. One could dock a few points for the lack of a compelling bridge, but those points would be scooped back up thanks to the chorus' combustible assonance and the morphing of the word "roar" into a two-syllable rallying cry.</p>
			
			<p><strong>2. Legendary Lovers</strong> - Perry name-checks Cleopatra and Shakespeare's Juliet in describing the eternal passion she and her man could experience on this mystical love song. The singer's multi-cultural excavations are proudly rattled off, but the hook tidily simplifies Perry's intent as the drums are unforgivingly clobbered.</p>
			
			<p><strong>3. Birthday</strong> - Taking the fairly straightforward lyrical concept of birthday-as-sex and making the absolute most of it, Perry outclasses Rihanna's "Birthday Cake" and shimmies through a blazing brass party. Dr. Luke, Martin and Cirkut concoct a delicious nugget of synth candy, but the star here is Perry, who keeps her tongue firmly in cheek during the salacious verses before teetering between power and falsetto on the hook.</p>
			
			<p><strong>4. Walking on Air </strong>"Walking on Air" shirks the double entendres of "Birthday" and allows Perry to re-imagine herself as a progressive house artist, complete with brassy backup vocals bridging the gaps in her euphoric lyrics. Credit to Klas Ahlund, a frequent Robyn collaborator, for knowing precisely how to utilize Perry's layered vocals on this crackerjack genre stop.</p>
			
			<p><strong>5. Unconditionally</strong> - The beat drips toward a drain, a distant voice cries something undecipherable, and Perry sounds defeated before committing to "your bad days with your good." Perry has described "PRISM's" second single as her favorite song on the album, and while "Unconditionally" is more difficult to uncork than, say, "Birthday," the visceral ballad successfully conveys Perry's most prized possession: a relationship with zero asterisks.</p>
			
			<p><strong>6. Dark Horse feat. Juicy J</strong> - The pop singer sashays toward trap music on "Dark Horse" and absolutely scores; the dank, murmuring production on the song is not the easiest track to navigate, but Perry shape-shifts into a lip-puckering femme fatale and slays. Oddly, the album's lone guest, Juicy J, can't make a simile stick ("She eat your heart out/Like Jeffrey Dahmer!"), but Perry rescues "Dark Horse" with a barn-burning final chorus.</p>
			
			<p><strong>7. This Is How We Do</strong> - There's a reason that Perry repeats the phrase "It's no big deal" on the pre-chorus in "This Is How We Do" -- the song is a paean for stakes-free frivolity, from the keyboard blasts that puncture the hook to the ingenious "Mariah Carey-oke" line. The "bring the beat back!" outro is a bit laborious, but at this point, Perry has earned the right to showcase her sillier side.</p>
			
			<p><strong>8. International Smile</strong> - The kicky pop-rock ode to Perry's pal, jet-setting producer Mia Moretti, closes out the first half of "PRISM" on the lightest of steps. "International Smile" shifts to third-person point of view as Perry studies her friend's global savvy, and features another ardent breakdown, this time using a funked-up vocoder breakdown that would make Daft Punk green with envy (if they weren't, you know, robots).</p>
